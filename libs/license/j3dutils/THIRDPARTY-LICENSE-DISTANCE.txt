License Agreement for the Wild Magic (Version 2) Software Library
Revision 1: January 28, 2004

THIS WILD MAGIC (VERSION 2) SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("Agreement")
is made by and between Magic Software, Inc. ("We/Us/Our"), a North
Carolina corporation, having its principal place of business at 6006
Meadow Run Court, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27516 and any person or
legal entity using or accepting any software governed by this
Agreement ("You/Your"). This Agreement shall be effective on the first
day you use or accept software ("The Software") governed by this
Agreement, whichever is earlier.

THE PARTIES AGREE as follows:

1. Grant. We grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, and perpetual
   license to use The Software subject to the terms and conditions of the
   Agreement:

   (a) There is no charge to you for this license.

   (b) The Software may be used, edited, modified, copied, and
       distributed by you for noncommercial products.

   (c) The Software may be used, edited, modified, copied, and
       distributed by you for commercial products provided that such
       products are not intended to wrap The Software solely for the
       purposes of selling it as if it were your own product. The
       intent of this clause is that you use The Software, in part or
       in whole, to assist you in building your own original
       products. An example of acceptable use is to incorporate the
       graphics portion of The Software in a game to be sold to an end
       user.  An example that violates this clause is to compile a
       library from only The Software, bundle it with the headers
       files as a Software Development Kit (SDK), then sell that SDK
       to others. If there is any doubt about whether you can use The
       Software for a commercial product, contact us and explain what
       portions you intend to use. We will consider creating a
       separate legal document that grants you permission to use those
       portions of The Software in your commercial product.

2. Limitation of Liability. We will have no liability for special,
   incidental or consequential damages even if advised of the
   possibility of such damages. We will not be liable for any other
   damages or loss in any way connected with The Software.

3. Warranties. We make no warranties at all. The Software is
   transferred to you on an as-is basis. You use The Software at your
   own peril. You assume all risk of loss for all claims or
   controversies, now existing or hereafter, arising out of use of The
   Software. We shall have no liability based on a claim that your use
   or combination of The Software with products or data not supplied
   by us infringes any patent, copyright, or proprietary right. All
   other warranties, expressed or implied, including, without
   limitation, any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a
   particular purpose are hereby excluded.


4. Taxes and Duties. You shall pay or reimburse us for federal, state,
   provincial, local or other tariffs, duties and taxes not based on
   our net income, including all taxes, tariffs, duties, or amounts
   levied in lieu thereof, based on charges payable under this
   Agreement or based on The Software, its use or any services
   performed hereunder, whether such tariffs, duties or taxes are now
   or hereafter imposed under the authority of any federal, state,
   provincial, local or other jurisdiction.

5. Entire Agreement, Amendments. This Agreement represents the
   complete and exclusive statement of the Agreements between the
   parties relating to the licensing of The Software and maintenance
   of The Software and supersedes all prior Agreements and
   representations between them relating to such
   licensing. Modifications to this Agreement shall not be effective
   unless in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement
   is sought. The terms of this Agreement shall not be amended or
   changed by any purchase order or acknowledgment even if we have
   signed such documents.

6. North Carolina Law, Severability. This Agreement will be governed
   by North Carolina law. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
   unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, it shall be deemed
   severable from and shall in no way affect the validity or
   enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

7. Force Majeure. It is herein agreed that neither party to this
   Agreement shall be liable for delays for failures in performance
   resulting from acts beyond the control of such party. Such acts
   include, without limitation, acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots,
   acts of war, epidemics, governmental regulations superimposed after
   the fact, fire, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters.
